# GUI for flight bookings

This code is for the 1st assignment for the subject Human-computer interaction, held at UL FRI, year 2022/23. 
The code represents a GUI for flight bookings, and it was implemented using the NetBeans IDE (version 15).

The code should work by just cloning it and opening it in NetBeans. Any "errors" should be reported by 
NetBeans, and then the project can be ran.
